👉 ################ what is distributed fs ################ 
A Distributed File System (DFS) is designed to manage and access files stored across multiple physical servers or nodes in a network. Example - HDFS , Example glusterFS 
• Location Transparency: Users don’t need to know where files are physically stored.
• Redundancy: Files are often replicated across nodes to prevent data loss.
• Scalability: Easily accommodates growing data volumes by adding more nodes.
Fault Tolerance: If one node fails, data can still be accessed from replicas.

👉 ################  difference between SAN & NAS ################ 

Here's a clear comparison between SAN (Storage Area Network) and NAS (Network Attached Storage) — two popular enterprise storage solutions:
🧠 Key Differences Between SAN and NAS
Feature	SAN (Storage Area Network)	NAS (Network Attached Storage)
Access Type	Block-level access	File-level access
Protocol Used	Fibre Channel, iSCSI	NFS, SMB/CIFS
Performance	High-speed, low latency	Moderate speed, suitable for general file access
Use Case	Databases, virtualization, high-performance apps	File sharing, backups, media storage

👉 ################ differnce between ext2 & ext4  ################ 
Feature	ext2	ext4
Journaling	❌ No journaling	✅ Journaling supported
Performance	Slower due to lack of journaling	Faster due to journaling and extents

👉 ################ Journaling ################

Journaling is a technique used in modern file systems to protect data integrity by recording changes in a special log (called a journal) before applying them to the main file system. This helps recover quickly and safely after crashes or power failures.

🔄 How It Works:
	1. Write-Ahead Logging: Before modifying files or metadata, the system writes a summary of the changes to the journal.
	2. Commit Phase: Once the journal entry is safely written, the actual changes are applied to the file system.
Recovery: If a crash occurs, the system reads the journal and completes or rolls back incomplete operations.

👉 ################ what is inode & what does it contains ################
An inode is a data structure used by Unix-like file systems to store metadata about a file or directory—excluding its name and actual data. It contains critical information like file size, ownership, permissions, timestamps, and pointers to data blocks.
When a file system is created, a fixed number of inodes is allocated. Each inode is uniquely identified by an inode number, and the system uses this number to locate and manage files

👉 ################  where is the filename stored ################
In Linux and other Unix-like file systems, the filename is stored in the directory entry, not in the inode itself.
