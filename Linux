👉 ################ what is distributed fs ################ 
A Distributed File System (DFS) is designed to manage and access files stored across multiple physical servers or nodes in a network. Example - HDFS , Example glusterFS 
• Location Transparency: Users don’t need to know where files are physically stored.
• Redundancy: Files are often replicated across nodes to prevent data loss.
• Scalability: Easily accommodates growing data volumes by adding more nodes.
Fault Tolerance: If one node fails, data can still be accessed from replicas.

👉 ################  difference between SAN & NAS ################ 

Here's a clear comparison between SAN (Storage Area Network) and NAS (Network Attached Storage) — two popular enterprise storage solutions:
🧠 Key Differences Between SAN and NAS
Feature	SAN (Storage Area Network)	NAS (Network Attached Storage)
Access Type	Block-level access	File-level access
Protocol Used	Fibre Channel, iSCSI	NFS, SMB/CIFS
Performance	High-speed, low latency	Moderate speed, suitable for general file access
Use Case	Databases, virtualization, high-performance apps	File sharing, backups, media storage

👉 ################ differnce between ext2 & ext4  ################ 
Feature	ext2	ext4
Journaling	❌ No journaling	✅ Journaling supported
Performance	Slower due to lack of journaling	Faster due to journaling and extents

👉 ################ Journaling ################

Journaling is a technique used in modern file systems to protect data integrity by recording changes in a special log (called a journal) before applying them to the main file system. This helps recover quickly and safely after crashes or power failures.

🔄 How It Works:
	1. Write-Ahead Logging: Before modifying files or metadata, the system writes a summary of the changes to the journal.
	2. Commit Phase: Once the journal entry is safely written, the actual changes are applied to the file system.
Recovery: If a crash occurs, the system reads the journal and completes or rolls back incomplete operations.

👉 ################ what is inode & what does it contains ################
An inode is a data structure used by Unix-like file systems to store metadata about a file or directory—excluding its name and actual data. It contains critical information like file size, ownership, permissions, timestamps, and pointers to data blocks.
When a file system is created, a fixed number of inodes is allocated. Each inode is uniquely identified by an inode number, and the system uses this number to locate and manage files

👉 ################  where is the filename stored ################
In Linux and other Unix-like file systems, the filename is stored in the directory entry, not in the inode itself.

👉 ################ what is raw device ################
A raw device is that same block device accessed without formatting or mounting a file system.
• /dev/sda → Entire disk as a raw device.
/dev/sdb1 → A partition as a raw device.

👉 ################ Rsync ################
Rsync works by synchronizing files and directories between two locations, transferring only the differences (deltas) instead of copying everything, which makes it fast and efficient
Basic sync (local):
rsync -av /source/ /destination/
Remote sync (over SSH):
rsync -avz /local/path user@remote:/remote/path

👉 ################ how would you check data integrity (data which is copied from rsync from prod to DR site)  ################

✅ Methods to Check Data Integrity After Rsync
1. Checksum Comparison
Generate checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA256) for files on both source and destination.

Compare the outputs to ensure they match.

bash
# On both source and destination
find /path/to/files -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > checksums.txt
Then use diff or cmp to compare the checksum files.

✅ 2. Rsync with --checksum Option
Run rsync again with the --checksum flag to force a block-by-block comparison.

bash
rsync -avc --dry-run /source/ user@dr:/destination/
-c tells rsync to use checksum comparison.

--dry-run ensures no files are actually transferred—just checked.

✅ 3. File Count and Size Comparison
Use find, wc, and du to compare file counts and total sizes.

bash
# Count files
find /source -type f | wc -l
find /destination -type f | wc -l

# Total size
du -sh /source
du -sh /destination
✅ 4. Use diff or cmp for Specific Files
For critical files, compare directly:

bash
diff /source/file /destination/file
cmp /source/file /destination/file
✅ 5. Automated Scripts
Create a script that generates checksums, compares them, and logs discrepancies.

Useful for large-scale or repeated integrity checks.

🛡️ Best Practices
Always run integrity checks after large transfers or before failover.

Automate checks 

👉 ################ how would you troubleshoot disk IO issues ################

1. Identify Symptoms
Slow application performance
High load average
Unresponsive system or delays in file access

2. Check System Load - Use top or htop to see if high load is due to I/O wait:
3. Use iostat for Disk Metrics
iostat -xz 1

Key metrics:
r/s, w/s: read/write operations per second
await: average wait time (high = bad)
%util: disk utilization (near 100% = bottleneck)
7. Check for File System Issues  - dmesg 
8. Review Mount Options - Ensure optimal mount options (e.g., noatime) to reduce unnecessary writes.

👉 ################ why do you use noatime flag to mount a partition in fstab  & what are advantages & why your application vendor suggested those settings? ################

Using the noatime flag in /etc/fstab when mounting a partition is a performance optimization technique, especially useful for applications with frequent file reads.

✅ Advantages of noatime
Improved Performance: Reduces write operations, especially beneficial for read-heavy workloads.
Less Disk Wear: Ideal for SSDs where write cycles are limited.
Better Scalability: Helps in high-throughput environments like web servers or databases.
